**Abstract** - Imaging in low light is challenging due to low pho- ton count and low SNR. Short-exposure images suffer from noise, while long exposure can induce blur and is often impractical. A variety of denoising, deblurring, and en- hancement techniques have been proposed, but their effec- tiveness is limited in extreme conditions, such as video-rate imaging at night. To support the development of learning- based pipelines for low-light image processing, we intro- duce a dataset of raw short-exposure low-light images, with corresponding long-exposure reference images. Using the presented dataset, we develop a pipeline for processing low-light images, based on end-to-end training of a fully- convolutional network. The network operates directly on raw sensor data and replaces much of the traditional im- age processing pipeline, which tends to perform poorly on such data. We report promising results on the new dataset, analyze factors that affect performance, and highlight op- portunities for future work.
