Playing Atari with Six Neurons,https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01363v2,https://gym.openai.com/,"Deep reinforcement learning, applied to vision-based problems like Atari games, maps pixels directly to actions; internally, the deep neural network bears the responsibility of both extracting useful information and making decisions based on it. By separating the image processing from decision-making, one could better understand the complexity of each task, as well as potentially find smaller policy representations that are easier for humans to understand and may generalize better. To this end, we propose a new method for learning policies and compact state representations separately but simultaneously for policy approximation in reinforcement learning. State representations are generated by an encoder based on two novel algorithms: Increasing Dictionary Vector Quantization makes the encoder capable of growing its dictionary size over time, to address new observations as they appear in an open-ended online-learning context; Direct Residuals Sparse Coding encodes observations by disregarding reconstruction error minimization, and aiming instead for highest information inclusion. The encoder autonomously selects observations online to train on, in order to maximize code sparsity. As the dictionary size increases, the encoder produces increasingly larger inputs for the neural network: this is addressed by a variation of the Exponential Natural Evolution Strategies algorithm which adapts its probability distribution dimensionality along the run. We test our system on a selection of Atari games using tiny neural networks of only 6 to 18 neurons (depending on the game's controls). These are still capable of achieving results comparable---and occasionally superior---to state-of-the-art techniques which use two orders of magnitude more neurons.",Manan,Hard,"Reinforcement Learning, Neuro evolution",N,
Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602,https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment,"We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.",Manan,Medium,"Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning",Y,
PULSE: Self-Supervised Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration of Generative Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03808,https://www.kaggle.com/lamsimon/celebahq,"The primary aim of single-image super-resolution is to construct high-resolution (HR) images from corresponding low-resolution (LR) inputs. In previous approaches, which have generally been supervised, the training objective typically measures a pixel-wise average distance between the super-resolved (SR) and HR images. Optimizing such metrics often leads to blurring, especially in high variance (detailed) regions. We propose an alternative formulation of the super-resolution problem based on creating realistic SR images that downscale correctly. We present an algorithm addressing this problem, PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration), which generates high-resolution, realistic images at resolutions previously unseen in the literature. It accomplishes this in an entirely self-supervised fashion and is not confined to a specific degradation operator used during training, unlike previous methods (which require supervised training on databases of LR-HR image pairs). Instead of starting with the LR image and slowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high-resolution natural image manifold, searching for images that downscale to the original LR image. This is formalized through the ""downscaling loss,"" which guides exploration through the latent space of a generative model. By leveraging properties of high-dimensional Gaussians, we restrict the search space to guarantee realistic outputs. PULSE thereby generates super-resolved images that both are realistic and downscale correctly. We show proof of concept of our approach in the domain of face super-resolution (i.e., face hallucination). We also present a discussion of the limitations and biases of the method as currently implemented with an accompanying model card with relevant metrics. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality at higher resolutions and scale factors than previously possible.",Manan,Medium,"Computer Vision, Image processing, Generative Adversarial Networks",Y,
Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network,https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802,https://github.com/jbhuang0604/SelfExSR,"Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original high-resolution images than to those obtained with any state-of-the-art method.",Manan,Medium,"Image processing, Generative Adversarial Networks, Computer Vision",Y,

Temporal Segment Networks,https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02953,https://asankagp.github.io/mod20/,"Deep convolutional networks have achieved great success for image recognition. However, for action recognition in videos, their advantage over traditional methods is not so evident. We present a general and flexible video-level framework for learning action models in videos. This method, called temporal segment network (TSN), aims to model long-range temporal structures with a new segment-based sampling and aggregation module. This unique design enables our TSN to efficiently learn action models by using the whole action videos. The learned models could be easily adapted for action recognition in both trimmed and untrimmed videos with simple average pooling and multi-scale temporal window integration, respectively. We also study a series of good practices for the instantiation of TSN framework given limited training samples. Our approach obtains the state-the-of-art performance on four challenging action recognition benchmarks: HMDB51 (71.0%), UCF101 (94.9%), THUMOS14 (80.1%), and ActivityNet v1.2 (89.6%). Using the proposed RGB difference for motion models, our method can still achieve competitive accuracy on UCF101 (91.0%) while running at 340 FPS. Furthermore, based on the temporal segment networks, we won the video classification track at the ActivityNet challenge 2016 among 24 teams, which demonstrates the effectiveness of TSN and the proposed good practices.",Achleshwar,Medium,"Action Recognition, Computer Vision",Y,
FairMOT: On the Fairness of Detection and Re-Identification in Multiple Object Tracking,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01888v5.pdf,https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT20/,"There has been remarkable progress on object detection and re-identification (re-ID) in recent years which are the key components of multi-object tracking. However, little attention has been focused on jointly accomplishing the two tasks in a single network. Our study shows that the previous attempts ended up with degraded accuracy mainly because the re-ID task is not fairly learned which causes many identity switches. The unfairness lies in two-fold: (1) they treat re-ID as a secondary task whose accuracy heavily depends on the primary detection task. So training is largely biased to the detection task but ignores the re-ID task; (2) they use ROI-Align to extract re-ID features which is directly borrowed from object detection. However, this introduces a lot of ambiguity in characterizing objects because many sampling points may belong to disturbing instances or background. To solve the problems, we present a simple approach FairMOT which consists of two homogeneous branches to predict pixel-wise objectness scores and re-ID features. The achieved fairness between the tasks allows FairMOT to obtain high levels of detection and tracking accuracy and outperform previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin on several public datasets",Achleshwar,Hard,"Object Tracking, Computer Vision",Y,
Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002v2.pdf,https://cocodataset.org/#download,"The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

One-Shot Object Detection with Co-Attention and Co-Excitation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12529v1.pdf,https://cocodataset.org/#download,"This paper aims to tackle the challenging problem of one-shot object detection. Given a query image patch whose class label is not included in the training data, the goal of the task is to detect all instances of the same class in a target image. To this end, we develop a novel co-attention and co-excitation (CoAE) framework that makes contributions in three key technical aspects. First, we propose to use the nonlocal operation to explore the co-attention embodied in each query-target pair and yield region proposals accounting for the one-shot situation. Second, we formulate a squeeze-and-co-excitation scheme that can adaptively emphasize correlated feature channels to help uncover relevant proposals and eventually the target objects. Third, we design a margin-based ranking loss for implicitly learning a metric to predict the similarity of a region proposal to the underlying query, no matter its class label is seen or unseen in training. The resulting model is therefore a two-stage detector that yields a strong baseline on both VOC and MS-COCO under one-shot setting of detecting objects from both seen and never-seen classes.",Achleshwar,Medium,"Object Detection, One-shot Learning, Computer Vision",Y,
DensePose: Dense Human Pose Estimation In The Wild,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00434v1.pdf,https://cocodataset.org/#densepose-2020,"In this work, we establish dense correspondences between an RGB image and a surface-based representation of the human body, a task we refer to as dense human pose estimation. We first gather dense correspondences for 50K persons appearing in the COCO dataset by introducing an efficient annotation pipeline. We then use our dataset to train CNN-based systems that deliver dense correspondence ‘in the wild’, namely in the presence of background, occlusions and scale variations. We improve our training set’s effectiveness by training an ‘inpainting’ network that can fill in missing ground truth values, and report clear improvements with respect to the best results that would be achievable in the past. We experiment with fullyconvolutional networks and region-based models and observe a superiority of the latter; we further improve accuracy through cascading, obtaining a system that delivers highly-accurate results in real time.",Achleshwar,Medium,"Pose Estimation, Computer Vision",Y,
EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946v5,http://image-net.org/download,"Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.",Achleshwar,Easy,"Scalable Image Classification, Convolutional Neural Networks",Y,

End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers.,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12872v3.pdf,https://cocodataset.org/#download,"We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster RCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines.",Tanuj,Hard,"Object Detection, Computer Vision",Y,

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for the segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin.

Sparse-to-Dense: Depth Prediction from Sparse Depth Samples and a Single Image,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07492,https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html,"We consider the problem of dense depth prediction from a sparse set of depth measurements and a single RGB image. Since depth estimation from monocular images alone is inherently ambiguous and unreliable, to attain a higher level of robustness and accuracy, we introduce additional sparse depth samples, which are either acquired with a low-resolution depth sensor or computed via visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms. We propose the use of a single deep regression network to learn directly from the RGB-D raw data, and explore the impact of number of depth samples on prediction accuracy. Our experiments show that, compared to using only RGB images, the addition of 100 spatially random depth samples reduces the prediction root-mean-square error by 50% on the NYU-Depth-v2 indoor dataset. It also boosts the percentage of reliable prediction from 59% to 92% on the KITTI dataset.

Dual Attention Network for Scene Segmentation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02983v4.pdf,https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/,"In this paper, we address the scene segmentation task by capturing rich contextual dependencies based on the selfattention mechanism. Unlike previous works that capture contexts by multi-scale features fusion, we propose a Dual Attention Networks (DANet) to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies. Specifically, we append two types of attention modules on top of traditional dilated FCN, which model the semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. The position attention module selectively aggregates the features at each position by a weighted sum of the features at all positions. Similar features would be related to each other regardless of their distances. Meanwhile, the channel attention module selectively emphasizes interdependent channel maps by integrating associated features among all channel maps. We sum the outputs of the two attention modules to further improve feature representation which contributes to more precise segmentation results. We achieve new state-of-the-art segmentation performance on three challenging scene segmentation datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and COCO Stuff dataset. In particular, a Mean IoU score of 81.5% on Cityscapes test set is achieved without using coarse data.",Tanuj,Medium,"Segmantation, Computer Vision",Y,

To address this challenging new task, we propose Siamese Mask R-CNN. It extends Mask R-CNN by a Siamese backbone encoding both reference image and scene, allowing it to target detection and segmentation towards the reference category. We demonstrate empirical results on MS Coco highlighting challenges of the one-shot setting: while transferring knowledge about instance segmentation to novel object categories works very well, targeting the detection network towards the reference category appears to be more difficult. Our work provides a first strong baseline for one-shot instance segmentation and will hopefully inspire further research into more powerful and flexible scene analysis algorithms.",Tanuj,Medium,"One-Short Learning, Segmentation, Computer Vision",Y,

CE-Net: Context Encoder Network for 2D Medical Image Segmentation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02740.pdf,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VPCvVsPgrfPNIl932xgU3XC_WFLUsXJR,"Abstract—Medical image segmentation is an important step

spatial information for 2D medical image segmentation. CE-

module, a context extractor and a feature decoder module. We

context extractor module is formed by a newly proposed dense

Gradient Centralization: A New Optimization Technique for Deep Neural Networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01461v2.pdf,https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz,"Optimization techniques are of great importance to effectively and efficiently train a deep neural network (DNN). It has been shown that using the first and second order statistics (e.g., mean and variance) to perform Z-score standardization on network activations or weight vectors, such as batch normalization (BN) and weight standardization (WS), can improve the training performance. Different from these existing methods that mostly operate on activations or weights, we present a newoptimization technique, namely gradient centralization (GC), which operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean. GC can be viewed as a projected gradient descent method with a constrained loss function. We show that GC can regularize both the weight space and output feature space so that it can boost the generalization performance of DNNs. Moreover, GC improves the Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient so that the training process becomes more efficient and stable. GC is very simple to implement and can be easily embedded into existing gradient based DNN optimizers with only one line of code. It can also be directly used to finetune the pre-trained DNNs. Our experiments on various applications, including general image classification, fine-grained image classification, detection and segmentation, demonstrate that GC can consistently improve the performance of DNN learning.

In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts like a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation.

Driven by that curiosity, we conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN \textbf{completely free of convolutions}, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed \textbf{TransGAN}, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution while decreasing embedding dimension, and a patch-level discriminator that is also transformer-based. We then demonstrate TransGAN to notably benefit from data augmentations (more than standard GANs), a multi-task co-training strategy for the generator, and a locally initialized self-attention that emphasizes the neighborhood smoothness of natural images.

Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.05424v2.pdf,http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/,"We introduce a new, efficient, principled and backpropagation-compatible algorithm for learning a probability distribution on the weights of a neural network, called Bayes by Backprop. It regularises the weights by minimising a compression cost, known as the variational free energy or the expected lower bound on the marginal likelihood. We show that this principled kind of regularisation yields comparable performance to dropout on MNIST classification. We then demonstrate how the learnt uncertainty in the weights can be used to improve generalisation in non-linear regression problems, and how this weight uncertainty can be used to drive the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.",Kushank,Easy,"Reinforcement Learning, Backpropagation, Bayesian learning",Y,
Multi-Level Factorization Net for person Re-Identification,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09132.pdf,https://www.kaggle.com/pengcw1/market-1501/data,"Key to effective person re-identification (Re-ID) is modelling discriminative and view-invariant factors of person appearance at both high and low semantic levels. Recently developed deep Re-ID models either learn a holistic single semantic level feature representation and/or require laborious human annotation of these factors as attributes. We propose Multi-Level Factorisation Net (MLFN), a novel network architecture that factorises the visual appearance of a person into latent discriminative factors at multiple semantic levels without manual annotation. MLFN is composed of multiple stacked blocks. Each block contains multiple factor modules to model latent factors at a specific level, and factor selection modules that dynamically select the factor modules to interpret the content of each input image. The outputs of the factor selection modules also provide a compact latent factor descriptor that is complementary to the conventional deeply learned features. MLFN achieves state-of-the-art results on three Re-ID datasets, as well as compelling results on the general object categorisation CIFAR-100 dataset.",Kushank,Medium,"Person Re-Identification, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning",N,
Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition,https://www.cs.cmu.edu//~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf,https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot,"The process of learning good features for machine learning applications can be very computationally expensive and may prove difficult in cases where little data is available. A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity between inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discriminative features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art performance on one-shot classification tasks.",Kushank,Medium,"Siamese Network, One-Shot Recgnition",Y,

SpinalNet: Deep Neural Network with Gradual Input ,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03347v2.pdf,https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html,"Over the past few years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered remarkable success in a diverse range of real-world applications. However, DNNs consider a large number of inputs and consist of a large number of parameters, resulting in high computational demand. We study the human somatosensory system and propose the SpinalNet to achieve higher accuracy with less computational resources. In a typical neural network (NN) architecture, the hidden layers receive inputs in the first layer and then transfer the intermediate outcomes to the next layer. In the proposed SpinalNet, the structure of hidden layers allocates to three sectors: 1) Input row, 2) Intermediate row, and 3) output row. The intermediate row of the SpinalNet contains a few neurons. The role of input segmentation is in enabling each hidden layer to receive a part of the inputs and outputs of the previous layer. Therefore, the number of incoming weights in a hidden layer is significantly lower than traditional DNNs. As all layers of the SpinalNet directly contributes to the output row, the vanishing gradient problem does not exist. We also investigate the SpinalNet fully-connected layer to several well-known DNN models and perform traditional learning and transfer learning. We observe significant error reductions with lower computational costs in most of the DNNs. We have also obtained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for QMNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, EMNIST (Letters, Digits, and Balanced), STL-10, Bird225, Fruits 360, and Caltech-101 datasets.",Naitik,Easy,"Image Classification, Computer Vision",Y,

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin.

 ShakeDrop Regularization for Deep Residual Learning ,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02375v3.pdf,https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html,"Overfitting is a crucial problem in deep neural networks, even in the latest network architectures. In this paper, to relieve the overfitting effect of ResNet and its improvements (i.e., Wide ResNet, PyramidNet, and ResNeXt), we propose a new regularization method called ShakeDrop regularization. ShakeDrop is inspired by Shake-Shake, which is an effective regularization method, but can be applied to ResNeXt only. ShakeDrop is more effective than Shake-Shake and can be applied not only to ResNeXt but also ResNet, Wide ResNet, and PyramidNet. An important key is to achieve stability of training. Because effective regularization often causes unstable training, we introduce a training stabilizer, which is an unusual use of an existing regularizer. Through experiments under various conditions, we demonstrate the conditions under which ShakeDrop works well.",Naitik,Medium,"Optimization , Convolutional Neural Networks , Computer Vision",Y,
Training Generative Adversarial Networks with Limited Data ,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06676v2.pdf,https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html,"Training generative adversarial networks (GAN) using too little data typically leads to discriminator overfitting, causing training to diverge. We propose an adaptive discriminator augmentation mechanism that significantly stabilizes training in limited data regimes. The approach does not require changes to loss functions or network architectures, and is applicable both when training from scratch and when fine-tuning an existing GAN on another dataset. We demonstrate, on several datasets, that good results are now possible using only a few thousand training images, often matching StyleGAN2 results with an order of magnitude fewer images. We expect this to open up new application domains for GANs. We also find that the widely used CIFAR-10 is, in fact, a limited data benchmark, and improve the record FID from 5.59 to 2.42.",Naitik,Medium,"Image Generation, Computer Vision, Generative Adversarial Networks",Y,

NATURAL TTS SYNTHESIS BY CONDITIONING WAVENET ON MEL SPECTROGRAM PREDICTIONS(Tacotron2),https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf,https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/,"This paper describes Tacotron 2, a neural network architecture for speech synthesis directly from text. The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize timedomain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features. We further demonstrate that using a compact acoustic intermediate representation enables significant simplification of the WaveNet architecture.",Manthan,Hard,"Natural Language Processing, Text To Speech",Y,

Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Given <text, audio> pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.",Manthan,Hard,"Natural Language Processing, Text To Speech",Y,
Wavenet,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499v2.pdf,https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/,"This paper introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms. The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.",Manthan,Medium,"Natural Language Processing, Text To Speech",Y,
XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08237.pdf,open entity,"With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.",Manthan,Medium,"Natural Language Processing, Named Entity Recognition",Y,
Evaluating the Utility of Hand-crafted Features in Sequence Labelling∗,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09075v1.pdf,https://github.com/synalp/NER/tree/master/corpus/CoNLL-2003,"Conventional wisdom is that hand-crafted features are redundant for deep learning models, as they already learn adequate representations of text automatically from corpora. In this work, we test this claim by proposing a new method for exploiting handcrafted features as part of a novel hybrid learning approach, incorporating a feature auto-encoder loss component. We evaluate on the task of named entity recognition (NER), where we show that including manual features for part-of-speech, word shapes and gazetteers can improve the performance of a neural CRF model. We obtain a F 1 of 91.89 for the CoNLL-2003 English shared task, which significantly outperforms a collection of highly competitive baseline models. We also present an ablation study showing the importance of auto-encoding, over using features as either inputs or outputs alone, and moreover, show including the autoencoder components reduces training requirements to 60%, while retaining the same predictive accuracy.",Manthan,Medium,"Natural Language Processing, Named Entity Recognition",Y,

One characteristic common among these models is the presence of rich initial word encodings. These encodings typically are composed of a recurrent character-based representation with dynamically and pre-trained word embeddings. However, these encodings do not consider a context wider than a single word and it is only through subsequent recurrent layers that word or sub-word information interacts. In this paper, we investigate models that use recurrent neural networks with sentence-level context for initial character and word-based representations. In particular we show that optimal results are obtained by integrating these context sensitive representations through synchronized training with a meta-model that learns to combine their states.",Manthan,Easy,"Natural Language Processing, POS Tagging",Y,
