**Abstract** - We present a class of efficient models called MobileNetsfor mobile and embedded vision applications.  MobileNetsare  based  on  a  streamlined  architecture  that  uses  depth-wise  separable  convolutions  to  build  light  weight  deepneural  networks.   We  introduce  two  simple  global  hyper-parameters  that  efficiently  trade  off  between  latency  andaccuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builderto choose the right sized model for their application basedon  the  constraints  of  the  problem.   We  present  extensiveexperiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and showstrong performance compared to other popular models onImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effective-ness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications anduse  cases  including  object  detection,  finegrain  classifica-tion, face attributes and large scale geo-localization
