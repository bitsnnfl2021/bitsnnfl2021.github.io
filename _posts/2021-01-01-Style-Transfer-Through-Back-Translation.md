**Abstract** - Style transfer is the task of rephrasing the
text to contain specific stylistic properties without changing the intent or affect
within the context. This paper introduces
a new method for automatic style transfer. We first learn a latent representation of
the input sentence which is grounded in a
language translation model in order to better preserve the meaning of the sentence
while reducing stylistic properties. Then
adversarial generation techniques are used
to make the output match the desired style.
We evaluate this technique on three different style transformations: sentiment,
gender and political slant. Compared
to two state-of-the-art style transfer modeling techniques we show improvements
both in automatic evaluation of style transfer and in manual evaluation of meaning
preservation and fluency
