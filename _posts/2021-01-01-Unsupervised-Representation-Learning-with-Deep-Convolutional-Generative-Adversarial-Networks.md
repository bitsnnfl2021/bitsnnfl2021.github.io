**Abstract** - In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has
seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised
learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help
bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsuper-
vised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative
adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and
demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training
on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolu-
tional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to
scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned
features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image repre-
sentations.
