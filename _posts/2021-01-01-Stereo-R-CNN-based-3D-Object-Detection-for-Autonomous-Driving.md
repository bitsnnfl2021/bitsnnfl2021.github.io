**Abstract** - We present a novel dataset captured from a VW
station wagon for use in mobile robotics and autonomous driving
research. In total, we recorded 6 hours of traffic scenarios at
10-100 Hz using a variety of sensor modalities such as high-
resolution color and grayscale stereo cameras, a Velodyne 3D
laser scanner and a high-precision GPS/IMU inertial navigation
system. The scenarios are diverse, capturing real-world traffic
situations and range from freeways over rural areas to inner-
city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. Our data is
calibrated, synchronized and timestamped, and we provide the
rectified and raw image sequences. Our dataset also contains
object labels in the form of 3D tracklets and we provide online
benchmarks for stereo, optical flow, object detection and other
tasks. This paper describes our recording platform, the data
format and the utilities that we provide.
