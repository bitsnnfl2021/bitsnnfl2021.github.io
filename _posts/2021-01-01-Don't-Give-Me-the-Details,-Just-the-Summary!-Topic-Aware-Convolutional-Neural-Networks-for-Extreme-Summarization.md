**Abstract** - We introduce extreme summarization, a new single-document summarization task whichdoes not favor extractive strategies and callsfor an abstractive modeling approach. The idea is to create a short, one-sentence newssummary answering the question “What is thearticle about?”. We collect a real-world, largescale dataset for this task by harvesting onlinearticles from the British Broadcasting Corpo-ration (BBC). We propose a novel abstrac-tive model which is conditioned on the ar-ticle’s topics and based entirely on convolu-tional neural networks. We demonstrate exper-imentally that this architecture captures long-range dependencies in a document and recog-nizes pertinent content, outperforming an or-acle extractive system and state-of-the-art ab-stractive approaches when evaluated automat-ically and by humans
